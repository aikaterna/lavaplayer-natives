# lavaplayer-natives
Native files compiled for use in https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer

A jitpack build can be found on the `original` branch of this repo. That artifact does not include mac M1 natives nor musl-based Linux 64-bit natives as the current native loader in lavaplayer does not support them.
